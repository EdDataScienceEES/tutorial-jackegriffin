## Tutorial aim

The aim of this content is to equip users with the knowledge and skills to efficiently manipulate and analyze data in `R` using both the `data.table` and `purrr` packages. This includes mastering high-performance data manipulation with `data.table` (e.g., importing, filtering, and transforming data) and streamlining workflows with `purrr`'s functional programming tools (e.g., iteration, mapping, and handling nested data).
